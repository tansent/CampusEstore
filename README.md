# CampusEstore
A website for students to rent books and tools from each other. 

The UI is not that spetacular but all the functions are working, such as database retriveing, register and login, adding to shopping cart, renting, paying transaction and etc. 

Please refer to TeamPrototypeDesign.docx for all the details of the website


The website is bigger than 25MB, unable to upload. You can contact me by email(tansentlee@gmail.com) for code if you want to use that for learning purpose.<br>

Cheers!
